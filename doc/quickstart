CodMon : Quick-start guide for IBIS


I - Creating tests

There is a shortcut for Ibis functionality tests, which have to be run by
outcmp_ibis_wrapper.pl (standard wrapper for Ibis functionality tests).
You can simply create a '.codmon' file in the app directory (the one
containing 'build.xml'), and add lines as follows:

--------.codmon----------------
<nbprocess> <args to ibis-prun, relative paths from 'build'>
2 `cat ../run-args` {net.gm}
-------------------------------

The {...} is a space-separated list of implementations (net.gm) to ignore for
this test.
You can add comments by '#', and disable tests by '//'. Several examples can
be found in the current ibis-apps tree.
Don't forget to add these files to the CVS :)

II - Ignoring tests

Sometimes, it may be useful to ignore a whole broken apps folder.
In this case, simply add the name of the directory to the 'local/ignoredirs'
file, in the codmon subdirectory.
Tests in this directory and its subdirectories will simply be ignored.
