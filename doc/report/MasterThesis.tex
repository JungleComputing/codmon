\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
In times when software projects become more and more complex, testing of this software becomes more and more important. Many software
related problems are caused by lack of testing of the software~\cite{TTCST}. One of the challenges of software engineering is to make
sure that the software behaves in the same way on different platforms. First, to run on multiple platforms the software must be written in a
platform independent language, for example Java~\cite{Java}. But even when software is written in such a platform independent language, there 
are still issues that must be dealt with, before one is able to run and test the software. Think about the configuration of the test environment 
or finding and installing all the prerequisite libraries etc etc. To solve these and other problems this thesis describes a multi-platform modular
test environment called \project{}. The \project{} project provides a set of virtual machines, in which Codmon is aleady installed and
preconfigured.

\subsection{Problem indication}
\label{subsec:Problemindication}
\TODO paper references for Hudson, Jenkins, Junit and CsUnit 


Now days there are numerous test frameworks and test environments available. For example there is \emph{Junit} for Java-unit testing and \emph{csUnit} for \CS{}-unit testing.
There are also different environments like Hudson, Jenkins which can build a project and run a series of (unit) tests against this project. All of the frameworks
and environments have bother there advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages of unit testing is that a software developer easily can add new \emph{functinal} unit tests.
One of the disadvantages is that unit testing ignores non-funtional tests like performance testing.
